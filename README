The program will run but not to specifications.
UPDATE: STUCK IN LOOP

I wrote as many lines as I could with the extra two days that you gave us and I hadn't
been testing it for a while and now the program gets stuck in a loop... 

I did not have enough time to complete this project. I had to plan activities for my
preschool room for much longer than I thought I would have to because one of my coworkers
decided to take the week off. I've been very busy. I will continue to work on it 
because I can see that the projects in the future will build off of it so I will need
it to be complete anyway. Because I hadn't finished the previous projects completely,
I had to do a lot more research and programming than I should have and it ended up
taking me a lot of time to figure out things I should have done already. I did discover
a good way to structure these projects that makes them easier to handle so I'm hopeful
this will result in a smoother experience for me from now on.

I will resubmit once I am happy with the project. It might take a couple more days but I
do have an hour long break this Thursday and Friday where I should be able to get
something done.
